Hi, I'm Tejas. I'm from India but I've been on plenty of adventures so far. Starting from volunteering in an agricultural village in Southern Israel, to relay-swimming a distance of 60km from Vortsjärv to Tartu in Estonia. I like to reflect on the experiences I've had and I enjoy writing. This is where I share my thoughts and writing with the world.

Here are some of my favourite pieces:

- [Crazy Winter Swimming in Estonia]({% post_url /adventure/2021-05-27-winter-swimming %})
- [Skip the Small Talk]({% post_url /code/2022-04-20-small-talk %})

I've also written for [sTARTUp Day](https://www.startupday.ee/), a leading business festival and [Digit](https://www.digit.dev/), a developers' conference here in Estonia.

- [Christoph Klink: Building great teams](https://www.startupday.ee/news/christoph-klink-from-antler-creating-the-right-conditions-for-building-great-teams)
- [Reedik Tuuling: Leveraging monorepos to build web-apps](https://www.digit.dev/blog/reedik-tuuling-leveraging-monorepo-at-ridango)
- [kood/Jõhvi: An Ode to Estonian Scrappiness and Unity](https://www.startupday.ee/news/johvi-coding-school-an-ode-to-estonian-scrappiness-and-unity)

When I was a student, I've also freelanced and written some pretty interesting copy for [Katana](https://katanamrp.com/)

Here are some samples:

- [Subcontract manufacturing](https://katanamrp.com/blog/subcontract-manufacturing/)
- [Lean manufacturing principles](https://katanamrp.com/lean-manufacturing/)
- [Types of inventory](https://katanamrp.com/types-of-inventory/)

Currently I live in the beautiful little city of Tartu in Estonia, and I'm open to work opportunities.
I am looking for roles in the DevOps/Data Engineering space or Content writing space.
