Hi, I'm Tejas. I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Tartu, Estonia.

I've been on plenty of adventures, starting from volunteering in an agricultural village in Southern Israel, to relay-swimming a distance of 60km from Vortsj√§rv to Tartu in Estonia. I like to reflect on the experiences I've had and I enjoy writing. This is where I share my thoughts and writing with the world.

Here are some of my favourite pieces:

- [Crazy Winter Swimming in Estonia]({% post_url /adventure/2021-05-27-winter-swimming %})
- [Skip the Small Talk]({% post_url /code/2022-04-20-small-talk %})

I've also written for [sTARTUp Day](https://www.startupday.ee/), a leading business festival and [Digit](https://www.digit.dev/), a developers' conference here in Estonia.
